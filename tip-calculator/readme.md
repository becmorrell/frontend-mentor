### Challenges ðŸ§ 

**CSS**

  * I found using the selector `tip-container > *` useful to style with padding instead of adding it individually to each child inside that container. 
  * I created a simple setup for this project to be able to flow easily from mobile device to desktop.

  * Used a `@media (hover: hover)` query to only allow hover states on hover-capable devices.



**JavaScript:**

I practiced the following:

* Using `ParseFloat()` to pass a number entered by the user into a floating point number.
* Adding `eventListener` on all buttons:
                            * for each button, the correct percentage is calculated
                            * for the custom input button, the input is calculated into a percentage.

* Added "active" state to selected tip button:
                                        * using `document.querySelectorAll("active)` to remove classlist prior to adding new active state (This allows only one button to be selected at any particular time).
                                        * added active state to current event target.

* Created ```function calculation()```:
                                        * Calculates total tip per person to be paid.
                                        * Calculates total price per person including tip. 
                                        * Rounds to 2 decimal places.
                                        * Will not run if number of people is not entered.
                                        * Updates instantly as cost / tip / number of people is changed by user.
