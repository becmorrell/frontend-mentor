## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the second project - this really helped to embed some of the html and css properties I used from the last project. 

learning points: 
- when styling ```<h1> and <p>``` in my css I orginally started out trying to style the container, however soon realised that styling the text is more appropriate - for eg text-align: left. 
- Inserting button and achieveing a hover state 
- Using @media queries to make a responsive design - Initially I struggled with positioning the 'web-image' and the 'community-profile' - however when I placed them inside another flexbox, this made positioning much easier with the responsive design.
- The first time inserting social icons onto the page - this was difficult to position them inside the circle when the height of 'fb' symbol was distorting the circle to be more like an oval. 
  - I  learnt to treat the icons as 'text' to style them
  - placing them in flexboxes and then using multiple 'classes' so that I could style them all in one go which is far more efficient. 



### Continued development

- Continue to develop use of flexbox
- More practice with use of buttons
- More work needed on the responsive design (positioning of boxes as the screen widens)
- For future projects - try to make classes reusable to make project more efficient where possible
