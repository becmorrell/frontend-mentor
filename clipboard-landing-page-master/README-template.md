## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is the first junior project I have completed, I used this to apply my knowledge of flexbox and use throughtout the design.

- moving from the mobile design to desktop and scaling the content to the correct size so that it will look good on any size device
- I found the footer difficult to replicate the design with flex-box - possibly a grid would work better for this as my `nav` would not wrap 
- I feel confident with adding buttons, images, icons and creating hover states for them
